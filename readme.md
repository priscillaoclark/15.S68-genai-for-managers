# Homework Assignments for 15.268 Generative AI for Managers

## Assignment 1: AI Agents

Description: This assignment builds off of the examples from Lecture 3 on understanding price
gouging by leveraging AI agents. You will choose a new product idea: you can be as creative as
you want or pick a product you’d be interested in forming a startup around / launching at an
existing company. Then construct a focus group of AI agents to help inform your decision about
whether to introduce the product, how to market it, how to deal with any concerns. The
deliverables are a written report (just 1 page single spaced, or 2 double spaced), plus supporting
materials and a Google Sheet summarizing your work. If you use ChatGPT please also include a
shareable link to your prompting thread.

## Assignment 2: Memo to the CEO

Description: Choose one of the companies in the excel below and act as the Head of Strategy to write a memo addressed to the CEO of a company. In the memo you must:
Explain the current positioning of the company’s AI strategy (it’s possible for it to encompass more than one segment of the value chain or even none of them if they don’t have a strong strategy currently). Who are their competitors? How are they matching up? Quantify everything you can on market size and share. Cite all sources using footnotes and superscripts.

Make an argument for a pivot the company should take given the new gen AI ecosystem. Which segment of the AI value chain should they try to end up in? Why? What moats do they have? If they shouldn’t pivot, what must they do to strengthen their current position? Should they just stay out of AI entirely? Defend your argument with BOTH numbers and intuition.
