# Homework Assignments for 15.268 Generative AI for Managers

## Assignment 1: AI Agents

Description: This assignment builds off of the examples from Lecture 3 on understanding price
gouging by leveraging AI agents. You will choose a new product idea: you can be as creative as
you want or pick a product youâ€™d be interested in forming a startup around / launching at an
existing company. Then construct a focus group of AI agents to help inform your decision about
whether to introduce the product, how to market it, how to deal with any concerns. The
deliverables are a written report (just 1 page single spaced, or 2 double spaced), plus supporting
materials and a Google Sheet summarizing your work. If you use ChatGPT please also include a
shareable link to your prompting thread.
