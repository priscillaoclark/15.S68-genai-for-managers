      "\n",
      "**Key Components:**\n",
      "1. **Canine-Adapted Guitar:** A lightweight, durable guitar with enlarged tactile strumming surfaces and vibration feedback to help dogs understand when a correct chord is played.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Scent-Emitting Fret Markers:** Specially developed to appeal to a dog's powerful sense of smell, these scented markers guide the dog’s paws to the correct strings, providing both tactile and olfactory cues for learning chords.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Eco-Friendly Design:** Made from sustainable materials, the guitar is not only eco-friendly but also chew-resistant, ensuring both safety and durability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Target Market:**\n",
      "PupStrings primarily targets dog owners who are enthusiastic about enriching their pets' cognitive and physical activities. Ideal customers include pet owners with a passion for music, tech-savvy individuals who enjoy connecting their pets to smart devices, and those seeking innovative and interactive toys for their dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Unique Selling Points:**\n",
      "- **Innovative Approach:** First of its kind to fuse musical training with pet-friendly technology.\n",
      "- **Multi-Sensory Learning:** Utilizes touch, sound, and scent to create a truly engaging learning experience for dogs.\n",
      "- **Smart Integration:** The integrated app and AI feedback provide a modern and novel way for dogs to interact with music, offering insights similar to human music classes.\n",
      "- **Enrichment and Bonding:** Strengthens the bond between pet and owner through shared musical activities and learning, while also enhancing the dog's cognitive skills and providing physical exercise.\n",
